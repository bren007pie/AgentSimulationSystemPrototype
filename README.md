## Agent Simulation System Prototype ##

Video game non-playable characters (NPCs) often demonstrate
unbelievable reactions to the world around them. A tool that may help
is an emotion engine that might promote code reuse and allow developers
to abstract away NPC decision-making by programming with emotions. In
this work, I demonstrated the feasibility of integrating the EMgine
emotion component library into the Unity game engine. I created a
prototype agent simulation system where *Joy* intensity is
automatically generated for an NPC based on environmental changes.
